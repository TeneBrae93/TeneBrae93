# Hi there, I'm Tyler Ramsbey! 👋

### About Me

I sit at the intersection of **Software Development** and **Information Security**. I am passionate about not only breaking systems to make them stronger but also contributing code to fix the vulnerabilities I discover. My philosophy is full-cycle security: find it, fix it, ship it.

### Major Open Source Contributions

I am an active contributor to the open-source community, focusing on security tools and large-scale platforms.

#### **GhostCMS**
* **The Highlight:** I discovered a security vulnerability within the GhostCMS platform.
* **The Fix:** Rather than just reporting it, I authored the patch to fix my own CVE findings, ensuring the ecosystem remained secure for thousands of users.

#### **CloudGoat (Rhino Security Labs)**
* Top contributor to **CloudGoat**, the leading "Vulnerable by Design" AWS deployment tool.
* Helped create scenarios that allow security professionals to hone their cloud exploitation skills in a safe environment.

#### **Pacu (The AWS Exploitation Framework)**
* **Role:** Module Developer
* Expanded the capabilities of **Pacu**, the standard open-source tool for offensive AWS security.
* **Contribution:** Authored and merged **multiple new modules**, allowing researchers to test new attack vectors and identify misconfigurations in cloud environments.

### Custom Security Tools

Beyond contributing to major frameworks, I maintain a collection of **custom tools and scripts** tailored for:
* **Red Teaming Operations**
* **Penetration Testing Automation**
* **Security Research & Reconnaissance**

Check out my repositories below to see the specific scripts I use to automate exploitation and streamline security assessments.

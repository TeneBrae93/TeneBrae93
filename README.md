# Hi there, I'm Tyler Ramsbey! 👋

### About Me

I sit at the intersection of **Software Development** and **Information Security**. I am passionate about not only breaking systems to make them stronger but also contributing code to fix the vulnerabilities I discover. My philosophy is full-cycle security: find it, fix it, ship it.
